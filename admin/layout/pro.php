			<h2>Amazon Integration</h2>
			<h4>Connects your site with Amazon in just a click</h4>
			<p>If you want the Amazon data to be imported to your site, you don't have to do it manually. Add the product ID and, by just clicking a button, the name, image, affiliate link, and price will be transferred. Saves a lot of time.</p>
			<h4>Synchronizes the prices with Amazon</h4>
			<p>The add-on automatically synchronizes the prices with the ones from Amazon, so you won't have to do it manually everytime they change. Because prices vary all the time and you probably have better stuff to do instead of tracking them.</p>
